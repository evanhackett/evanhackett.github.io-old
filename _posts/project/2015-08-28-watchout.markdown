####Watchout!
Watchout! is a game where the player moves an orb around in attempt to avoid the flying shurikens. The main purpose of the project was to learn and use the D3.js library in a fun way. "Watchout!" was one of the first assignments I did while attending Hack Reactor. Collect the cyan orbs to slow down the flying shurikens! What is your high score?
