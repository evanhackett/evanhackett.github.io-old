Ever since I was a kid I have loved playing around with retro console emulators. My favorite system is the Super Nintendo, but that
sounded too hard to emulate as a first attempt in emulation. After doing some research, I decided the Chip-8 was a good place to start. The emulator is written in javascript, no frameworks or libraries were used.
